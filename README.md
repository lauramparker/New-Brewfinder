>   Brewfinder is a simple application that returns a list of local breweries based on a user's zipcode.  When the application opens, the user is instructed to enter a zipcode to find local breweries.  A list of breweries within that zipcode appears below.  The brewery listings include name, type , address, phone, and website (if available).  The data source for the brewery's listing information is Open Brewery DB (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/), a free dataset and API with public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops.   Within each brewery listing card, the user can click on a "favorite" button to add that brewery to a compiled list of favorites among all users.  In the upper right corner a "Favorite Breweries" button appears and will generate the complete corwdsourced list of favorites when clicked.

Brewfinder utilizes JQuery to create html elements for each set of brewery information (name, type, address, phone, website); and, those information fields are appended to individual cards. Standard AJAX calls are used to populate the data and images needed for each listing. Styling for the cards and container elements of the application is provided by UIKit, which is the embedded CSS toolkit utilized by BrewFinder.
